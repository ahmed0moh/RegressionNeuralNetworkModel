# RegressionNeuralNetworkModel
I'm starting with uploading the data and then splitting it into X for predictors and y for targets. the second thing is to normalizing the data and building the Neural Network Model with 5 layers each of them had 10 nodes. and finally is to start training and fitting the data to evaluate the mean and standard deviation of the mean square errors.
